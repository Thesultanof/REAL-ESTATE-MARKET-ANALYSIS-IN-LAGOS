## INTRODUCTION
### BACKGROUND
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of rental property listings and tenant interactions across various locations in Lagos, Nigeria. With the real estate market evolving rapidly due to economic conditions, urbanization, and demographic shifts, understanding rental trends is crucial for both landlords and prospective tenants. The research leverages SQL-driven queries applied to structured property datasets to derive insights into multiple key areas, including pricing variations across different locations, engagement levels of tenants with rental properties, effectiveness in lease conversions, and overall market growth dynamics.

Lagos, as a commercial hub, experiences diverse rental patterns shaped by factors such as housing demand, affordability, and property type preferences. Some areas exhibit premium rental rates due to their desirability, infrastructure development, and commercial viability, whereas others demonstrate affordability suited for mid-income and lower-income tenants. This study assesses which locations maintain consistently high-value rental listings and which ones face challenges such as low engagement or prolonged vacancy periods.

Furthermore, tenant interactions provide a significant indicator of rental market activity. By examining tenant behavior—such as the frequency of property inquiries, engagement duration before lease agreement finalization, and abandonment rates—the study aims to uncover trends in tenant preferences and decision-making. Additionally, SQL-based queries explore the correlation between lease success rates and pricing models, identifying potential bottlenecks or opportunities for optimization within rental agreements.

Market growth dynamics are also a focal point, as understanding the trajectory of rental demand helps real estate stakeholders predict future pricing fluctuations, regional competitiveness, and economic impact. By applying structured analytical methods, this study provides actionable insights that can inform landlords, tenants, investors, and policymakers about critical aspects influencing the Lagos rental market.

This research aims to fill gaps in knowledge regarding rental property trends, helping stakeholders optimize pricing strategies, improve tenant engagement, and enhance lease management for sustainable market growth.

## Limitations
- AI-Generated Dataset – The dataset used for this analysis was generated using AI and does not represent actual real estate transactions or market records. It is designed for educational and analytical purposes.
- Market Variability – Rental prices and tenant engagement trends can fluctuate due to economic conditions, policy changes, and seasonal variations, which are not captured in this static dataset.
- User Behavior Assumptions – The inactivity of tenants does not necessarily indicate disengagement; external factors such as relocation, financial constraints, or alternative housing options may contribute to reduced interactions.
- Listing Status Interpretation – Properties classified as “stale” may still hold market value but could be affected by pricing strategy, visibility, or demand shifts.
- Lease Success Rate Considerations – The lease success percentage is based on structured data but does not account for informal rental agreements or private negotiations outside recorded transactions.


## CONCLUSION
This report highlights key market trends within Lagos’ rental property sector using SQL-based insights. While high-end rental listings dominate specific areas, engagement levels and lease success rates remain robust across the city. Addressing inactive listings and optimizing pricing models can enhance market efficiency and attract a broader range of tenants.
